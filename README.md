# UFOs
## Overview  
The purpose of this project is to compile a database of UFO sightings onto an html-formatted user-responsive webpage that the user can search using different criteria such as by date or city or state or appearance of the object.  This webpage makes use of several javascript, css, and data files provided in the static folder.  
### Results  
### Webpage navigation
The default webpage loads a table containing a list of UFO sightings with header information such as data, city, state, country, and shape.  One can reset this table by clicking the "UFO Sightings" hyperlink in the top left corner highlighted in blue.

### Filtering the Table  
To filter the table use the "Filter Search" menu on the left and type in the search criteria using the same format as shown in the example texts.

The resulting table will be filtered to show the results. For example filtering for January 10, 2010:

### Drawbacks and Recommendations   
The page does not allow for filtration based on duration or comments. Also, the database that this webpage is based on is likely being updated on a regular basis and this webpage's table likely does not reflect the most updated and complete database. The following recommendations are advised:  
* Add a filter that allows one to filter based on comments or keywords in comments  
* Maintain an updated database that this webpage uses to build its tables
* Perhaps add a filter to filter based on duration of sighting
